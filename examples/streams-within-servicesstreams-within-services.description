//This example depicts how the streaming rules can be used within services to process incoming requests in the background.
//In this example, the incoming requests are fed into a global stream, and if the number of requests from the same host
//is greater than 5, a log is printed. This example can be extended to make decisions based on the output of the streaming
//rules.
